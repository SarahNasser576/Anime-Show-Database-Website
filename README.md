# Website description

This anime show database website allows you to search for anime shows and add or edit new show entries. As of now, this website does not allow you to search for anime characters or add or edit new characters. Mangas that haven't been adapated into anime yet are not included in the list of show entries on this website. You can only search for titles, show previews, genres, writers, and tags. 

# Note
You can type any number of characters in the search bar. If you enter the letter "t," for example, you will get all anime shows that contain the letter "t" in its title, preview, writer, or in at least one of its genres or tags. The search feature is not case-sensititve, and typing no characters in the search bar or only typing whitespaces will give you all anime show search results.

# How to run my program
1. Have the GitHub repository code saved on an IDE or terminal. Ensure that all files are in their right folders.
2. Install Python on your terminal. If you're using macOS, type the command: **brew install python**. If you're using Windows, type the command: **py --version**, but if Python is still not installed, download it from https://www.python.org/ and check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
3. OPTIONAL: create a virtual environment. In your terminal, inside the project folder, type the command: **python -m venv venv**. Then activate it: **venv\Scripts\activate**. If you have followed these steps correctly, you will see (venv) at the beginning of the terminal line.
4. Install Flask on your terminal. Type the command: **pip install Flask**.
5. In the terminal, type the command: **python server.py**. You will get a website link with port number 5001. For example, you might see "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5001" in your terminal.
6. Copy and paste that link into your web browser. That will open up the website.
7. Have fun!
